# MindfulTube

**MindfulTube** is a minimalist chrome extension and Flask backend designed to promote intentional YouTube use. Instead of an endless feed or autoplaying recommendations, it offers:

- One search at a time  
- One video at a time
- No homepage feed
- No suggested videos after playback

The goal: reduce algorithm-driven distraction and encourage mindful media consumption.

## How It Works

1. Enter a YouTube search in the popup
2. Choose from a filtered list (no Shorts, no spam)
3. Watch your selected video in a clean player
4. Return to a blank state â€” no autoplay, no feed
